    "# Text Classification [30pts]\n",
    "In this problem (again!), you will be analyzing the Twitter data we extracted using [this](https://dev.twitter.com/overview/api) api. This time, we extracted the tweets posted by the following six Twitter accounts: `realDonaldTrump, mike_pence, GOP, HillaryClinton, timkaine, TheDemocrats`\n",
    "\n",
    "For every tweet, we collected two pieces of information:\n",
    "- `screen_name`: the Twitter handle of the user tweeting and\n",
    "- `text`: the content of the tweet.\n",
    "\n",
    "We divided the tweets into three parts - train, test and hidden test - the first two of which are available to you in CSV files. For train, both the `screen_name` and `text` attributes were provided but for test, `screen_name` was hidden.\n",
    "\n",
    "The overarching goal of the problem is to \"predict\" the political inclination (Republican/Democratic) of the Twitter user from one of his/her tweets. The ground truth (i.e., true class labels) is determined from the `screen_name` of the tweet as follows\n",
    "- `realDonaldTrump, mike_pence, GOP` are Republicans\n",
    "- `HillaryClinton, timkaine, TheDemocrats` are Democrats\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, this is a binary classification problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "The problem proceeds in three stages:\n",
    "1. **Text processing (8pts)**: We will clean up the raw tweet text using the various functions offered by the [nltk](http://www.nltk.org/genindex.html) package.\n",
    "2. **Feature construction (10pts)**: In this part, we will construct bag-of-words feature vectors and training labels from the processed text of tweets and the `screen_name` columns respectively.\n",
    "3. **Classification (12pts)**: Using the features derived, we will use [sklearn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html) package to learn a model which classifies the tweets as desired. \n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned earlier, you will use two new python packages in this problem: `nltk` and `sklearn`, both of which should be available with anaconda. However, NLTK comes with many corpora, toy grammars, trained models, etc, which have to be downloaded manually. This assignment requires NLTK's stopwords list and WordNetLemmatizer. Install them using:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  >>>nltk.download('stopwords')\n",
    "  >>>nltk.download('wordnet')\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "Verify that the following commands work for you, before moving on.\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  >>>lemmatizer=nltk.stem.wordnet.WordNetLemmatizer()\n",
    "  >>>stopwords=nltk.corpus.stopwords.words('english')\n",

    "1. The tokens must all be in lower case.\n",
    "2. The tokens should appear in the same order as in the raw text.\n",
    "3. The tokens must be in their lemmatized form. If a word cannot be lemmatized (i.e, you get an exception), simply catch it and ignore it. These words will not appear in the token list.\n",
    "4. The tokens must not contain any punctuations. Punctuations should be handled as follows: (a) Apostrophe of the form `'s` must be ignored. e.g., `She's` becomes `she`. (b) Other apostrophes should be omitted. e.g, `don't` becomes `dont`. (c) Words must be broken at the hyphen and other punctuations. \n",

    "And finally, we are ready to put things together and learn a model for the classification of tweets. The classifier you will be using is [`sklearn.svm.SVC`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.svm.SVC.html#sklearn.svm.SVC) (Support Vector Machine). [Here](http://docs.opencv.org/2.4/doc/tutorials/ml/introduction_to_svm/introduction_to_svm.html) is a nice introduction to SVMs for the curious minded. (But we will cover it in the class soon!)\n",
    "\n",
    "At the heart of SVMs is the concept of kernel functions, which determines how the similarity/distance between two data points in computed. `sklearn`'s SVM provides four kernel functions: `linear`, `poly`, `rbf`, `sigmoid` (details [here](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/svm.html#svm-kernels)) but you can also implement your own distance function and pass it as an argument to the classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through the various functions you implement in this part, you will be able to learn a classifier, score a classifier based on how well it performs and use it for prediction tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, you will carry out the following tasks in order:\n",
    "1. Implement the `learn_classifier()` function assuming `kernel` is always one of {`linear`, `poly`, `rbf`, `sigmoid`}. Stick to default values for any other optional parameters.\n",
    "2. Implement the `evaluate_classifier()` function which scores a classifier based on accuracy.\n",
    "3. Call `learn_classifier()` and `evaluate_classifier()` for each of the four kernel modes and determine what performs the best (this code has been written for you already).\n",
    "4. Go back to `learn_classifier()` and fill in the best mode."

However, in this problem, you will use training data as the validation data as well.\n",

    "2. **And what metric?** There are several evaluation measures available in the literature (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F-1,etc) and different fields have different preferences for specific metrics due to different goals. We will go with accuracy. According to wiki, **accuracy** of a classifier measures the fraction of all data points that are correctly classified by it; it is the ratio of the number of correct classifications to the total number of (correct or incorrect) classifications.\n",
