You will have to generate this yourself. \n", "\n", "Using the `all_trips` function that you implemented in homework 2, you can split the dataframe into separate trips. You will first process each trip into a form more natural for the regression setting. For each trip, you will need to locate the point at which a bus passes the bus stop to get the time at which the bus passes the bus stop. From here, you can calculate the true label for all prior datapoints, and throw out the rest. \n", "\n", "### Importing functions from homework 2\n", "\n", "Using the menu in Jupyter, you can import code from your notebook as a Python script using the following steps: \n", "1.

In the case where there are multiple entries with the exact same minimal distance, you should just consider the first one that occurs in the trip (so truncate everything after the first occurance of minimal distance). \n", "3. Assume that the row with the smallest Euclidean distance to the bus stop is also the true time at which the bus passes the bus stop. Using this, create a new column called `eta` that contains for each row, the number of minutes until the bus passes the bus stop (so the last row of every trip will have an `eta` of 0).\n", "4.
